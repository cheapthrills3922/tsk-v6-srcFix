                        <h2>Best local food to try in Oman</h2>
                        <p>
                            Omani cuisine is a flavorful mix of Arabian, Indian, and Persian influences, offering a
                            unique taste of the region. A must-try dish is Shuwa, a slow-cooked lamb marinated with
                            spices and roasted underground for up to 48 hours, traditionally served during festivals.
                            Majboos, a spiced rice dish with meat or seafood, is another local favorite. Mashuai, a
                            grilled kingfish dish served with lemon rice, showcases Oman's rich seafood culture. Harees,
                            a wheat and meat porridge, is popular during Ramadan. For dessert, Halwa, a sweet,
                            gelatinous treat made with saffron, rose water, and nuts, is a must-try. Omani food is a
                            perfect blend of spice, aroma, and tradition.

                        <p>
                            <strong>The best time to visit Oman is during the cooler months, from October to
                                April,</strong> when temperatures range between 17°C to 30°C (63°F to 86°F), making it
                            ideal for sightseeing, desert adventures, and outdoor activities. This period is perfect for
                            exploring Muscat's landmarks, hiking in Wadi Shab, and enjoying Wahiba Sands.
                        </p>

                            The coastal areas, like Salalah, offer pleasant weather and lush greenery during the Khareef
                            <strong>monsoon season from June to September,</strong> attracting nature lovers.
