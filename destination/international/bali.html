                        <h2>Best local food to try in Bali</h2>
                        <p>
                            Bali's local food is a delicious blend of Balinese, Indonesian, and international
                            influences, offering rich flavors and aromatic spices. A must-try dish is Babi Guling
                            (suckling pig), a famous Balinese delicacy with crispy skin and spiced meat. Another iconic
                            dish is Bebek Betutu, a slow-cooked duck infused with local spices.
                            For a taste of Indonesian flavors, try Nasi Goreng (fried rice) and Mie Goreng (fried
                            noodles), often served with egg and satay. Nasi Campur, a mixed rice dish with meats,
                            vegetables, and sambal, is a staple at local warungs (small eateries).
                            Seafood lovers can enjoy Grilled Jimbaran seafood, while vegetarians can try Gado-Gado, a
                            salad with peanut sauce. For dessert, taste Dadar Gulung, a green coconut pancake filled
                            with palm sugar.
                            Whether dining at a beachside café or a traditional warung, Bali's food scene offers
                            something for every palate.

                        <h2>Right time to visit Bali</h2>
                        <p>
                            The best time to visit Bali is during the <strong>dry season, from April to
                            October,</strong> when the weather is warm, sunny, and ideal for outdoor activities like
                            beach hopping, surfing, and temple visits. This is also the peak tourist season, especially
                            in July and August, as well as during holidays like Christmas and New Year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For fewer crowds and more affordable prices, <strong>the shoulder months of April, May,
                            June, and September</strong> are perfect, offering great weather and better deals on
                            accommodations and tours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <strong>rainy season, from November to March,</strong> brings heavier rainfall and higher humidity, but
                            Bali remains lush and vibrant. While beaches and outdoor activities may be affected, this is
                            a great time for cultural experiences, yoga retreats, and exploring Bali's scenic rice
                            terraces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the best mix of weather, crowd levels, and affordability, <strong>visiting in May, June,
                            or September is highly recommended.</strong>
